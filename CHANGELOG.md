# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2025-11-18)

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Complete refactor from netbox-circuitmaintenance to netbox-notices

This is the initial release of the fully refactored plugin, now supporting both maintenance and outage tracking across multiple NetBox object types.

### New Features

* **Outage Tracking**: New Outage model for unplanned outages with automatic timestamps
* **Generic Impact Tracking**: Associate impacts with any NetBox object (circuits, devices, VMs, etc.)
* **Reschedule Functionality**: Reschedule maintenance events with automatic status updates
* **Timeline View**: Visual timeline of all changes and events
* **Choice Constants**: All ChoiceSet classes now define constants (STATUS_*, IMPACT_*)
* **Impact Field**: Added impact text field to BaseEvent for describing event impact
* **Reported At**: Outage model includes reported_at timestamp with timezone conversion
* **Timezone Support**: Automatic timezone conversion and display for all timestamp fields
* **Changelog Tracking**: Proper changelog tracking for reschedule operations and related objects
* **PyPI Publishing**: Automated GitHub Actions workflow for PyPI releases

### API Changes

* REST API support for Maintenance and Outage models
* API serializers include all new fields (impact, reported_at, replaces)

### Infrastructure

* NetBox 4.4.1+ compatibility
* Python 3.10+ required
* Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions
* MkDocs documentation with GitHub Pages deployment

### Migration Notes

This is a completely new plugin architecture. Previous versions (0.6.0 and earlier as netbox-circuitmaintenance) are not compatible.
